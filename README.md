# Rails authentication template

This is just a simple Rails starter with authentication from scratch, following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@wintermeyer/authentication-from-scratch-with-rails-5-2-92d8676f6836).

To get started, just clone this repo and run:
- `bundle install` to install the Ruby dependencies
- `yarn` or `npm install` to install the JavaScript dependencies.

This was made with Ruby 2.6.5 and Rails version 6.0.2. I don't know if it's the right way to make Rails templates.
